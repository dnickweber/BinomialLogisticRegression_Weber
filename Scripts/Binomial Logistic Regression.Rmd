#Loading necessary libraries. If these libraries have not yet been installed, perform 'install.packages("package name")' before loading the library via 'library(package name)'.

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

library(vegan)

#Reading in the dataset (which can be found in the "Data" folder in the GitHub repo).
blacktip_raw <- read.csv("./Data/Blacktip_Datasheet_Quant.csv", na.strings=c("", " ", "NA"))
```

```{r}
#Cleaning dataset: Removing 2 rows (1 shark without i-STAT blood stress data and 1 shark with no known mortality outcome because tags were removed before release).
blacktip_cleaned <- blacktip_raw[-c(5,6), ]

#Just ensuring that R realizes these 2 variables are categorical and not continuous.
blacktip_cleaned$Mortality <- factor(blacktip_cleaned$Mortality)
blacktip_cleaned$Condition <- factor(blacktip_cleaned$Condition)
```

```{r}
#Now performing a PCA, to determine which variables are explaining the majority of the variation in the dataset. I have a lot of potential explanatory variables, and I believe weeding down the potential variables via a PCA is more informative than throwing all of the variables into a logistic regression model.

#Selecting which variables I want to include in PCA (PCA does not accept categorical variables).
columns_for_pca <- c("Fight.Time..min.", "pH", "Lactate..mmol.L.", "Handling.Time..min.", "Fork.Length..cm.", "Water.Temp...C.")
pca_dataframe <- data.frame(blacktip_cleaned[ , columns_for_pca])
pca_dataframe_naomitted <- na.omit(pca_dataframe)

#Conducting PCA in ggplot, and scaling all continuous variables. 
autoplot(prcomp(scale(pca_dataframe_naomitted)), shape=FALSE, label.size=3, loadings=TRUE, loadings.label=TRUE, loadings.label.size=3, loadings.colour='black', loadings.label.colour='black', data=blacktip_cleaned, colour='Mortality')

#Again, the point of this PCA was to determine which variables should be included in the logistic regression models. This PCA demonstrates that 'pH' and 'Lactate' are negatively correlated (as expected) and thus competing for the same variation. Thus, it is appropriate to remove one of the two, and I am choosing to remove 'Lactate' in the later analyses. Additionally, 'Handling Time' and 'Fork Length' are positively correlated (which makes sense, larger sharks are handled for longer period of time), and thus also competing for the same variation. For that reason, I am choosing to remove 'Fork Length' in the later analyses. In sum, the results of this PCA suggest to get rid of 2 of 6 variables for the logistic regression, and I am choosing to get rid of 'Lactate' and 'Fork Length'.
```

```{r}
#Simply visualizing relationships between potential explanatory variables.
pairs(Mortality ~ Fight.Time..min. + Handling.Time..min. + Hook.Location + Fork.Length..cm. + Condition + pH + Lactate..mmol.L. + Water.Temp...C., data=blacktip_raw, na.action=na.omit, panel=panel.smooth)

#From this plot, we can see that 'pH' and 'Lactate' are negatively correlated, and 'Fork Length' is relatively positively correlated with both 'Fight Time' and 'Handling Time' (consistent with the results of the PCA above). 
```

```{r}
#Now that I have analyzed and accounted for relationships between explanatory variables, I am moving on to the binomial logistic regression, in an attempt to predict for mortality. I am predicting mortality for all sharks combined (i.e. combining sharks caught from shore and sharks caught from charter boats) - with 3 mortalities and 29 survivors. 

#General layout of the intended final models... where "Environment" includes variables such as "Water Temp", "Fight Time", "Handling Time", etc...
#Model 1: Mortality ~ Environment
#Model 2: Mortality ~ Environment + Fishing Method
#Model 3: Mortality ~ Environment * Fishing Method (looking at interaction)
```

```{r}
##MODEL 1

#Starting with the full possible model, using the variables selected for above, via PCA. However, I am also including the variable 'Condition' here, which is categorical and thus could not be included in the PCA.

mod.1 <- glm(Mortality ~ Fight.Time..min. + Handling.Time..min. + Condition + pH + Water.Temp...C., family="binomial", data=blacktip_cleaned) #"Logit" is the default model when family is "binomial".
summary(mod.1)
Anova(mod.1, type=3) #AIC=28.634

#Now taking a backwards stepwise approach to get the best fitting model (i.e. removing the least significant variable at each step)...

mod.1.1 <- glm(Mortality ~ Handling.Time..min. + Condition + pH + Water.Temp...C., family="binomial", data=blacktip_cleaned)
summary(mod.1.1)
Anova(mod.1.1, type=3) #AIC=26.900

mod.1.2 <- glm(Mortality ~ Handling.Time..min. + Condition + pH, family="binomial", data=blacktip_cleaned)
summary(mod.1.2)
Anova(mod.1.2, type=3) #AIC=25.491

mod.1.3 <- glm(Mortality ~ Handling.Time..min. + pH, family="binomial", data=blacktip_cleaned)
summary(mod.1.3)
Anova(mod.1.3, type=3) #AIC=22.323

mod.1.4 <- glm(Mortality ~ pH, family="binomial", data=blacktip_cleaned)
summary(mod.1.4)
Anova(mod.1.4, type=3) #AIC=20.360 and p=0.05948

#The above model (mod.1.4), with only pH as an explanatory variable, is the best fitting model based on AIC scores.
```

```{r}
##MODEL 2

#Moving on to Model 2, which involves taking 'Fishing Method' into account (i.e. determining if shore-based vs. charter-based affects mortality).

#Taking same backwards stepwise approach as above (i.e. starting with full possible model and removing the least significant variable at each step). Again, only real difference between this model and the model above is that I am now taking 'Fishing Method' into account.

mod.2 <- glm(Mortality ~ Fight.Time..min. + Handling.Time..min. + Condition + pH + Water.Temp...C. + Fishing.Method, family="binomial", data=blacktip_cleaned) 
summary(mod.2)
Anova(mod.2, type=3) #AIC=18.000

mod.2.1 <- glm(Mortality ~ Fight.Time..min. + Handling.Time..min. + Condition + pH + Fishing.Method, family="binomial", data=blacktip_cleaned)
summary(mod.2.1)
Anova(mod.2.1, type=3) #AIC=27.884

mod.2.2 <- glm(Mortality ~ Handling.Time..min. + Condition + pH + Fishing.Method, family="binomial", data=blacktip_cleaned)
summary(mod.2.2)
Anova(mod.2.2, type=3) #AIC=26.166

mod.2.3 <- glm(Mortality ~ Handling.Time..min. + Condition + pH, family="binomial", data=blacktip_cleaned)
summary(mod.2.3)
Anova(mod.2.3, type=3) #AIC=25.491

mod.2.4 <- glm(Mortality ~ Handling.Time..min. + pH, family="binomial", data=blacktip_cleaned)
summary(mod.2.4)
Anova(mod.2.4, type=3) #AIC=22.323

mod.2.5 <- glm(Mortality ~ pH, family="binomial", data=blacktip_cleaned)
summary(mod.2.5)
Anova(mod.2.5, type=3) #AIC=20.360 and p=0.05948

#As above, the above model (mod.2.5), with only pH as an explanatory variable, is the best fitting model based on AIC scores. The full model (mod.2) actually has a lower AIC score (18.000), but because this model has so many explanatory variables, I believe the final model (mod.2.5) with only pH as an explanatory variable is more informative and biologically meaningful. 
```

```{r}
##MODEL 3

#Now moving on to Model 3 and taking into account the potential interaction between 'Fishing Method' and 'pH'.

mod.3 <- glm(Mortality ~ pH * Fishing.Method, family="binomial", data=blacktip_cleaned) 
summary(mod.3)
Anova(mod.3, type=3) #AIC=23.456

#There is no significant interaction between 'Fishing Method' and 'pH'. 
```

```{r}
#In summary, based on the backwards stepwise approach taken for the binomial logistic regression models, the variable 'pH' is the best predictor for whether or not a shark will survive post-release. To bring the analysis full circle, this result is not surprising when looking back at the PCA that was run initially - 2 of the 3 known mortalities fall almost exactly onto the axis of variation explained by 'pH'. 
```
