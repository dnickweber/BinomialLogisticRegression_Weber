#For my Master's thesis, I am studying the stress response and post-release mortality in blacktip sharks that are caught by recreational fishermen in 2 different fishing modes (shore-based vs. charter-based). I have sampled 32 blacktip sharks so far (including both shore-based and charter-based), and for each of those sharks I recorded the 'Fight Time' (i.e. time on the line), 'Handling Time' (i.e. time handled), and 'Fork Length' (i.e. length of the shark). I also drew blood from sharks to assess stress parameters ('pH' and 'Lactate' are included here). Upon the release of each shark, a 'Condition' (ranging from 1-5; 1 being showing no signs of stress and 5 being moribund) was assigned, based on the sharks behavior upon release. The 'Water Temperature' at each site was recorded. Finally, each shark was tagged, in order to monitor survivorship post-release. 

#The objective of this project is to conduct a binomial logistic regression, to determine if we can predict for the outcome of a released shark (i.e. whether the shark survives or dies) using the variables measured (and described above). 
```

```{r}
library(car)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggfortify)
library(vegan)

#Reading in dataset.
blacktip_raw <- read.csv(file="Blacktip_Datasheet_Quant.csv", na.strings=c("", " ", "NA"))
```

```{r}
#Cleaning dataset: Removing 2 rows (1 shark without i-STAT blood stress data and 1 shark with no known mortality outcome because tags were removed before release)...
blacktip_cleaned <- blacktip_raw[-c(5,6), ]
#Just ensuring that R realizes these variables are categorical and not continuous...
blacktip_cleaned$Mortality <- factor(blacktip_cleaned$Mortality)
blacktip_cleaned$Condition <- factor(blacktip_cleaned$Condition)

#Selecting which variables I want to include in PCA (PCA does not accept categorical variables)...
columns_for_pca <- c("Fight.Time..min.", "pH", "Lactate..mmol.L.", "Handling.Time..min.", "Fork.Length..cm.", "Water.Temp...C.")
pca_dataframe <- data.frame(blacktip_cleaned[ , columns_for_pca])
pca_dataframe_naomitted <- na.omit(pca_dataframe)

#Conducting PCA in ggplot, and scaling all continuous variables. 
autoplot(prcomp(scale(pca_dataframe_naomitted)), shape=FALSE, label.size=3, loadings=TRUE, loadings.label=TRUE, loadings.label.size=3, loadings.colour='black', loadings.label.colour='black', data=blacktip_cleaned, colour='Mortality')

#This PCA is telling me to choose either 'pH' or 'Lactate', and either 'Handling Time' or 'Fork Length' for regression purposes. This makes sense because 'pH' and 'Lactate' are negatively correlated (as they should be) and 'Handling Time' and 'Fork Length' (and really 'Fight Time') are positively correlated, which makes sense (i.e. larger sharks are both on the line and handled for longer period of time). So based on the results of this PCA, I can get rid of 2 of 6 variables for the regression, and I am choosing to get rid of 'Lactate' and 'Fork Length'...

#Predicting mortality for all sharks combined (i.e. combining sharks caught from shore and sharks caught from charter boats), with 3 mortalities and 29 survivors.

#Model 1: Mortality ~ Environment
#Model 2: Mortality ~ Environment + Fishing Method
#Model 3: Mortality ~ Environment * Fishing Method (looking at interaction)

#Simply visualizing relationships between potential explanatory variables.

#From this plot, we can see that 'pH' and 'Lactate' are negatively correlated, and 'Fork Length' is relatively positively correlated with both 'Fight Time' and 'Handling Time' (consistent with the results of the PCA above).

summary(mod.2.5)
Anova(mod.2.5, type=3) #AIC=20.360 and p=0.05948

#As above, the above model (mod.2.5), with only pH as an explanatory variable, is the best fitting model based on AIC scores. The full model (mod.2) actually has a lower AIC score (18.000), but because this model has so many explanatory variables, I believe the final model (mod.2.5) with only pH as an explanatory variable is more informative and biologically meaningful.

#Now moving on to Model 3 and taking into account the potential interaction between 'Fishing Method' and 'pH'.

mod.3 <- glm(Mortality ~ pH * Fishing.Method, family="binomial", data=blacktip_cleaned)

#There is no significant interaction between 'Fishing Method' and 'pH'.
